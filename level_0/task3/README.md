# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

// 跑在本地，不一定要部到测试网去
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js --network localhost
```
